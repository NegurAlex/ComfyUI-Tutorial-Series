A realistic photo of a worn, triangular yellow warning sign bolted to an old wooden post. In the center of the sign is a cartoon-style angry bunny, mid-leap, with fur puffed up, eyebrows furrowed, and tiny claws out like it's about to pounce. The design is simple and bold, like a typical safety symbol. Below the bunny, the text reads in all caps: "BEWARE OF BUNNY". The sign has scratches and scuff marks, giving it a weathered look. The background shows a slightly blurred forest path or natural area, adding to the realism.

The background is minimal and clean, with a hint of fog or gradient light, giving the whole scene a modern sci-fi feel—balanced, simple, and geometric.

A macro photo of freshly cooked golden French fries in a rustic metal basket, lined with crumpled brown parchment paper. The fries are thick-cut, perfectly crisp, and lightly salted, with a soft steam rising from them. The setting is warm and textured—placed on a weathered wooden table with visible grain and an old metal tray underneath. In the background, a dark linen cloth adds contrast with soft folds and shadows. The lighting is moody and natural, coming from the side, casting gentle highlights on the fries and deep shadows around the edges, giving it a cozy, artisan kitchen feel. Everything looks inviting, homemade, and beautifully imperfect.

A colorful mobile game start screen with a soft 3D-rendered style, playful and full of charm. At the top of the screen, the game logo says PIXAROMA in bright, rounded letters with a soft glow and a fun, bouncy look. Below the logo, there are two large buttons: one that says PLAY and another that says EXIT. The buttons are rounded, shiny, and slightly squishy-looking, with gentle highlights and drop shadows to make them pop.

In the background, a whimsical forest stretches out—filled with oversized mushrooms, glowing flowers, winding roots, and soft green hills. In the center of the scene stands a cute white bunny with big shiny eyes and fluffy fur, smiling with a curious expression. It's standing on a wooden stump, surrounded by small forest creatures and magical elements like floating petals and sparkles. The lighting is warm and dreamy, with soft shadows and pastel colors that make everything feel cozy and inviting.

A watercolor painting of a tiny gnome sitting on a mushroom in the middle of a peaceful forest clearing. He has a tall, slightly crumpled red hat, a round nose, and a big fluffy white beard that spills over his blue coat. The mushroom is wide and red with soft white spots, nestled among grass and scattered wildflowers. Light filters gently through leaves above, and everything feels calm, cozy, and full of charm. The background fades into soft splashes of color—pale greens, warm browns, hints of lavender—giving it a dreamy, storybook look.

A surreal fantasy scene of a woman levitating gracefully above the desert sands, her long white dress flowing endlessly in the air like silk caught in a storm. She floats in slow motion, her hair lifted by invisible wind, eyes closed as if in a dream. Around her, the golden desert is cracked and dry, scattered with twisted dead trees frozen in time. Ancient clocks, both melting and intact, float weightlessly around her—some embedded in the sand, others turning slowly in mid-air.

From above, a soft rain begins to fall—not harsh, but gentle and sparkling, like liquid light. As each droplet hits the ground, colorful wildflowers bloom instantly, spreading across the desert floor in a surreal explosion of color—lavenders, deep blues, fiery oranges. The sky is cinematic and dramatic, filled with moody clouds lit by streaks of sunlight breaking through, painting everything in rich contrast.

The whole scene has a painterly, dreamlike quality—epic, emotional, and timeless, like a moment from a forgotten myth.

The lighting is soft and diffused, creating smooth shadows that wrap around the curves of her fingers and the subtle folds of the fabric. The focus is sharp on the hand, while the pillow background falls slightly out of focus for a natural depth of field.
